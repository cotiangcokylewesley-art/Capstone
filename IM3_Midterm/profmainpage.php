            <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Effective and accessible administration of student attendance is critical in the modern educational setting. Conventional approaches, which frequently depend on manual record-keeping, are difficult, prone to mistakes, and do not provide real-time accessibility. In order to better serve the needs of administrators, teachers, and students, this paper presents a dynamic web-based platform that streamlines and improves student attendance management. The website, which was created with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a centralized system for viewing and editing student attendance data in addition to user management features and crucial institutional data.
	        <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The project provides a website wherein teachers can view and edit student attendance records for easier administrative handling. The website will hold a database that will retrieve data from a biometric scanner and record the time in and time out of the students. Admins will also be able to edit and delete users, and view audit logs which are detailed, chronological records of events and changes within the system which will help with security and accountability.
	        <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Regular attendance in class is essential because it has a big impact on students' academic performance, socioemotional development, and future opportunities.According to Daily et al. (2020)  chronic absenteeism is associated with academic difficulties and decreased use of school resources. This problem affects any organization where attendance is important, not just educational institutions. Problems also arise when using a traditional or manual approach to taking attendances like proxies are possible risks when attendances are taken manually (Nadhan et al., 2022).  Therefore, it is important to give careful thought to putting in place efficient attendance management systems. Even the study conducted by Suthari et al., (2023) agrees that to overcome the challenges or drawbacks of manual attendance taking methods automated attendance systems are needed.
	        <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  According to Rahman et al., (2023) an automated class attendance system also makes it less difficult for educators and administrators as they can keep tabs on students' attendance, monitor punctuality, and spot tardy or absent students. With this in mind, pairing the project with a website that will be able to provide a user friendly interface for both student and teacher alike will effectively enhance efficiency and effectiveness of an automated attendance system. Even according to the study conducted by Al-Emadi et al., (2021) where they emphasize the importance of user friendliness as it enables users to understand how to operate a system without the need to refer to a user manual.
